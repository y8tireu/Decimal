# Decimals

1. A fraction represents a part of a whole in the form numerator/denominator.
2. A decimal is another way to express fractions using powers of 10.
3. The numerator in a fraction tells how many parts are taken.
4. The denominator tells how many equal parts make up the whole.
5. A unit fraction has 1 as its numerator (e.g. 1/2, 1/4).
6. Fractions can be proper (numerator < denominator) or improper (numerator ≥ denominator).
7. A mixed number consists of a whole number and a proper fraction.
8. Converting a mixed number to an improper fraction involves multiplying the whole by the denominator and adding the numerator.
9. To add fractions, first find a common denominator.
10. The least common denominator (LCD) is the smallest common multiple of the denominators.
11. When adding fractions with the same denominator, simply add the numerators.
12. To subtract fractions, also convert them to have a common denominator.
13. Multiplying fractions involves multiplying numerators together and denominators together.
14. Before multiplying, cancel any common factors between numerators and denominators.
15. Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.
16. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping its numerator and denominator.
17. A terminating decimal has a finite number of digits after the decimal point.
18. A repeating decimal has one or more digits that repeat indefinitely.
19. Any fraction whose denominator (in lowest terms) contains only the factors 2 and/or 5 will yield a terminating decimal.
20. If the denominator (in lowest terms) has any prime factors other than 2 or 5, the decimal will repeat.
21. Converting a fraction to a decimal is done by dividing the numerator by the denominator.
22. To convert a terminating decimal to a fraction, write the decimal without the point as the numerator and use the appropriate power of 10 as the denominator.
23. Always simplify your fraction to lowest terms by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
24. Decimals are aligned by their decimal point when performing addition or subtraction.
25. Multiplying decimals: multiply as whole numbers then place the decimal point so that the product has as many decimal places as the sum of the factors’ decimal places.
26. Dividing decimals: shift the decimal point in the divisor to make it a whole number and do the same shift in the dividend.
27. Rounding decimals helps with estimation; look at the digit immediately after the desired place.
28. When rounding, if the next digit is 5 or more, round up; if less than 5, keep the digit the same.
29. Percentages are fractions with a denominator of 100.
30. To convert a fraction to a percentage, multiply by 100.
31. To convert a decimal to a percentage, move the decimal point two places to the right.
32. When comparing decimals, align them by adding trailing zeros if needed.
33. Converting decimals to fractions involves using the place value of the last digit.
34. Example: 0.75 becomes 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4.
35. A repeating decimal can be converted to a fraction using algebra (set the decimal equal to x, multiply to shift the repeat, subtract, and solve).
36. The bar notation (vinculum) over digits indicates a repeating sequence.
37. Example: 0.333… is written as 0.\overline{3} and equals 1/3.
38. An equivalent fraction is obtained by multiplying or dividing both numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number.
39. Fractions that look different can have the same value.
40. Always check for simplification to express your fraction in simplest form.
41. Mixed numbers and improper fractions are two different representations of the same value.
42. Decimals are preferred in measurements because they often represent approximate values.
43. Fractions are useful when exact values are needed.
44. A fraction can be converted to a decimal by long division.
45. In long division, if the remainder becomes zero, the decimal terminates.
46. If a remainder repeats, the decimal representation will repeat.
47. Place value is crucial: digits to the right of the decimal represent tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc.
48. The tenths place is the first digit after the decimal point.
49. The hundredths place is the second digit after the decimal.
50. Understanding place value helps in both reading and writing decimals.
51. A fraction’s value does not change if both its numerator and denominator are multiplied by the same number.
52. You can compare fractions by converting them to decimals.
53. Alternatively, convert fractions to have a common denominator to compare their sizes.
54. Multiplication of a whole number by a fraction can be done by writing the whole number as a fraction with denominator 1.
55. Example: 4 × (3/5) = (4/1) × (3/5) = 12/5.
56. Division of a whole number by a fraction involves multiplying the whole number by the reciprocal of the fraction.
57. Visual models such as pie charts or number lines help illustrate fractions.
58. A number line can be used to show the position of decimals and fractions relative to whole numbers.
59. In measurement problems, decimals often provide a clear representation of small differences.
60. In many cases (like money), decimals are preferred for their simplicity.
61. Fraction addition and subtraction require a common denominator to combine parts of a whole.
62. For adding unlike fractions, cross-multiplication can be used: (a/b) + (c/d) = (ad + bc)/(bd).
63. To simplify the addition process, always look for the least common multiple of the denominators.
64. When multiplying fractions, cancel common factors first to simplify calculations.
65. Dividing fractions by fractions is done by multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor.
66. Converting repeating decimals to fractions often results in a fraction in simplest form.
67. A good strategy for converting a decimal to a fraction is to write it over the appropriate power of 10, then reduce.
68. Decimals are essential in science for representing measurements with precision.
69. Fractions are common in cooking and recipes to denote exact proportions.
70. In probability, fractions represent the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
71. When comparing fractions and decimals, be aware that the two notations can express the same number.
72. The method of converting a fraction to a decimal through division is universal.
73. Converting decimals to percentages is a quick way to compare proportions.
74. In financial calculations, decimals are used to represent currency values.
75. Understanding decimals and fractions builds a foundation for algebra and higher math.
76. When converting an improper fraction to a mixed number, divide the numerator by the denominator.
77. The quotient gives the whole number part and the remainder becomes the new numerator.
78. Decimals can be expressed in scientific notation to manage very large or very small numbers.
79. Expressing decimals in scientific notation uses a power of 10 (e.g., 3.2 × 10^–4).
80. Fractions and decimals both fall under the category of rational numbers.
81. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
82. An irrational number, in contrast, cannot be written as a simple fraction.
83. Practice converting between fractions and decimals to improve fluency.
84. Estimation with decimals often involves rounding to the nearest tenth or hundredth.
85. When multiplying decimals, count the total number of decimal places from both factors.
86. Always check your final answer by converting back and forth between fractions and decimals.
87. In classroom settings, using manipulatives (like fraction strips) helps visualize operations.
88. Understanding the relationship between fractions and decimals aids in solving word problems.
89. Fractions can be used to represent ratios, which are foundational in statistics.
90. Decimals offer a linear way to see changes in value compared to fractional notation.
91. When performing arithmetic with decimals, aligning the decimal points is critical.
92. In subtraction, adding trailing zeros can help ensure correct alignment.
93. When converting a repeating decimal to a fraction, setting up an equation is an effective method.
94. The formula for converting a repeating decimal with one repeating digit is (repeating digit)/9.
95. For two repeating digits, it’s (repeating digits)/99, and so on.
96. Practice problems are key: work on multiple examples to master these techniques.
97. Online resources and interactive apps can provide extra practice with decimals and fractions.
98. Use estimation to verify that your computed fraction or decimal seems reasonable.
99. Memorize common conversions (e.g., 1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25, 1/3 ≈ 0.333…) for quicker calculations.
100. Consistent practice and review will build strong number sense and mathematical fluency with decimals and fractions.
